# netec
Noteï¼šThe first commit was *BEFORE* submission deadline, and was fully functional. Later commits were to fix typo and remove proprietary information. 

Unfortunately, some parts that contain proprietary information are needed to show NetEC's *feasibility* on real hardwares. So we leave it here for revision purposes.

We are currently working on a simulator version (P4 Bmv2). We will publicize the simulator version if needed.
